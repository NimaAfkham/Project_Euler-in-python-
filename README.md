Project Euler Solutions in Python

Welcome to my collection of solutions for Project Euler problems, written entirely in Python. This repository is a personal project where I’m working through as many of the Project Euler problems as I can, starting from Problem 0.

About the Project
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative problem-solving and efficient algorithms. This repository includes solutions to each problem in a dedicated Python script, with a focus on readability and optimization.

Structure
Each problem has its own Python file in this format: problem_<number>.py
Example: problem_1.py, problem_2.py, etc.

Each file includes:

A brief description of the problem
My solution to the problem in Python
Some comments explaining the code and any significant calculations

Requirements
To run these solutions, you’ll need:
Python 3.x installed on your system

Currently solved:
Problems 0 to 17
